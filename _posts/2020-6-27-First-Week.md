title: My first week at Qubu
---

Over the course of the week, I have been shadowing the director of a start up app called Qubu. When I first downloaded QuBu, I thought that the app was similar to other click and collect apps that were used for other stores, however, after I realised that the App would be useful especially during these difficult times, for many businesses and people as it not only reduces queue times but it would play a huge role in helping out people buying products from stores that don’t already have this service.


We started off the week by using a barcode scanning app called Orca Scan, in Qubu's first store. After that, we approached a few other local businesses in the area to ask them to join. We came across a local italian deli, and after watching the director persuaded the owner to join, it was my turn. I went into the newsagent next door, to try and get them onboard. They said they really liked the app, but couldn't join as they were selling their shop soon.


Later on in the week we had to use Qubu's content management system (cms) to upload all the products we scanned into the database so they would appear in the app. I didn’t enjoy this part, it was a really long and tedious process of data entry from an excel spreadsheet on to the system. I suggested that we focus on scanning just one category, this way there was one less input field, and we could scan alot more products faster. By going through this process it helped us understand any issues that the shop owners of the system would find frustrating.

 After this week, I see potential in QuBu, and understand the work that goes behind making the app including the persuasion of businesses to get on board and maintaining those relations as well as the technical work and ideas.


 From my first experience I enjoyed trying to persuade the owner of the newsagent after watching Yogi demonstrate how to influence and sell the app to a local coffee shop. As well as this I really look forward to learning how to help with the programming aspect of QuBu.


 One thing I didn’t enjoy was the long process of uploading products onto the app from the data entry excel spreadsheet as this was very time consuming.


 If I could go back in time I would have liked to suggest how to make the process of uploading items onto the app quicker and easier but suggesting ideas such as the idea that we could upload products under different categories rather than typing what category each product belonged to whilst entering the information for each product. However by going through this process it helped us to see any issues that maybe the users may find frustrating so overall it was a beneficial process.
